Laravel Breeze is a minimal and simple starting point for your authentication scaffolding in Laravel. It’s the successor to the laravel/ui package and is built using Tailwind CSS, AlpineJS and Blade Components. It publishes everything needed for auth into your project folder, which means it’s easily customizable - and even includes tests.
